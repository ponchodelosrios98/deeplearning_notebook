    "# GPU Instances on the cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Web Services has a service called Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows you to launch virtual servers (or “instances”), including instances with attached GPUs. The specific type of GPU instance you should launch is called “p2.xlarge”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select \"Launch an Instance\" in AWS EC2\n",
    "- Click on AWS Marketplace, and search for Deep Learning AMI with Source Code (CUDA 8, Ubuntu). Once you find the appropriate AMI, click on the \"Select\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Amazon Machine Image (AMI) contains all the environment files and drivers for you to train on a GPU. It has cuDNN, and many the other packages required for this course. Any additional packages required for specific projects will be detailed in the appropriate project instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Select the Instance Type\n",
    "You must next choose an instance type, which is the hardware on which the AMI will run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filter the instance list to only show “GPU compute”:\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the p2.xlarge instance type\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure the security Group\n",
    "\n",
    "Running and accessing a Jupyter notebook from AWS requires special configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, AWS restricts access to most ports on an EC2 instance. In order to access the Jupyter notebook, you must configure the AWS Security Group to allow access to port 8888.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on \"Edit security groups\".\n",
    "\n",
    "On the \"Configure Security Group\" page:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select \"Create a new security group\"\n",
    "2. Set the \"Security group name\" (i.e. \"Jupyter\")\n",
    "3. Click \"Add Rule\"\n",
    "4. Set a \"Custom TCP Rule\"\n",
    "5. Set the \"Port Range\" to \"8888\"\n",
    "6. Select \"Anywhere\" as the \"Source\"\n",
    "7. Click \"Review and Launch\" (again)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Login to the Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "From a terminal, navigate to the location where you stored your .pem file. (For example, if you put your .pem file on your Desktop, cd ~/Desktop/ will move you to the correct directory.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Type ssh -i YourKeyName.pem ubuntu@X.X.X.X, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- X.X.X.X is the IPv4 Public IP found in AWS, and\n",
    "- YourKeyName.pem is the name of your .pem file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you've used a different AMI or specified a username, ubuntu will be replaced with the username, such as ec2-user for some Amazon AMI's. You would then instead enter ssh -i YourKeyName.pem ec2-user@X.X.X.X\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configure Jupyter notebook settings\n",
    "In your instance, in order to create a config file for your Jupyter notebook settings, type: `jupyter notebook --generate-config.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to change the IP address config setting for notebooks (this is just a fancy one-line command to perform an exact string match replacement; you could do the same thing manually using vi/vim/nano/etc.), type: `sed -ie \"s/#c.NotebookApp.ip = 'localhost'/#c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'/g\" ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test the Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "*On the EC2 instance*\n",
    "- Clone a GitHub repository `git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-pytorch.git`\n",
    "- Enter the repo directory, and the CNN subdirectory\n",
    "    `cd deep-learning-pytorch`\n",
    "    `cd cnn-content`\n",
    "- Install the requirements `sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "- Start Jupyter notebook `jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser`\n",
    "\n",
    "*From your local machine*\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will need the token generated by your jupyter notebook to access it. On your instance terminal, there will be the following line: `Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time, to login with a token:`. Copy everything starting with the `:8888/?token=`.\n",
    "- Access the Jupyter notebook index from your web browser by visiting: `X.X.X.X:8888/?token=...` (where X.X.X.X is the IP address of your EC2 instance and everything starting with :8888/?token= is what you just copied).\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on a folder, like \"mnist\", to enter it and select a notebook, such as the \"mnist_mlp.ipynb\" notebook.\n",
    "Run each cell in the notebook.\n",
    "For some notebooks, you should see a marked decrease in training time when compared to running the same cells using a typical CPU!"
